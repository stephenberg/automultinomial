## Resubmission of version 2.0.0
Changes in this resubmission:
* added space before ``<http" in description file

* Added type checking of user input to give more informative error messages

* Made documentation more user friendly

* Removed some extraneous functions

* Added bootstrap confidence intervals

* Fixed a bug related to model parameterization
